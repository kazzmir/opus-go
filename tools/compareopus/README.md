# Native C / Go codec comparison

Run from the repository root (requires cgo and a C compiler):

```sh
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus test.opus
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -max-packets 100 test.opus test2.opus test3.opus
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -tolerance 1 -max-packets 100 big.opus
```

`-mode decode` (default) compares decoding; `-mode encode` compares encoding.
With no file arguments, it tries every `*.opus` (decode) or `*.wav` (encode)
in the current directory.
The `compareopus` build tag excludes this program from normal `go test ./...`.

The cgo directives in `main.go` use headers from `../opus/include` and statically
link `../opus/.libs/libopus.a`, relative to the repository root. This is the
native checkout found next to this repository; `../opus-go` is the Go checkout
itself. Build the native library first if necessary. Edit the two `#cgo`
directives if your native checkout is elsewhere. The program prints the linked
libopus version.

## Decode comparison

Each file gets independent, fresh C and Go decoders. The same Ogg audio packets
are decoded through each library's int16 API at 48 kHz, without FEC. Family 0
uses the ordinary decoder; families 1, 2, and 255 use multistream decoding with
the header's mapping. Other families are rejected.

This compares **raw decoder PCM**, including pre-skip and end padding. Neither
side applies OpusHead gain, pre-skip, or granule trimming: container playback
processing cannot mask decoder differences. Sample counts include all channels;
reported packet numbers are one-based, frame/channel indices are zero-based.

By default every sample must match exactly. The report includes the first sample
outside tolerance, total differing samples, samples outside tolerance, maximum
absolute difference, and RMS difference in int16 units. `-tolerance` optionally
allows small differences; exact mismatch counts remain visible. Native build
options, SIMD, and floating-point evaluation can affect bit-exactness; a
mismatch is evidence to investigate, not automatically proof of a Go bug.

Exit status is 0 only when all requested comparisons succeed, 1 for mismatches
or file/decode errors, and 2 for invalid options or no inputs. Empty audio
packets are rejected rather than silently treated as packet-loss concealment.
A read/decode error aborts that file, but subsequent files are still tried.
`-max-packets N` intentionally compares only a prefix; 0 (default) reads to EOF.

Initial decode checks against the local libopus 1.6.1:

- First 100 packets of `test.opus`, `test2.opus`, and `test3.opus`: exact matches.
- First 100 packets of `big.opus`: 26 differing samples, maximum difference 1.
- Full reads of the three test files encounter empty audio packets (packet 5648
  for `test.opus`/`test2.opus`, packet 103 for `test3.opus`), reported as errors.
  `test.opus` and `test2.opus` also first differ by 1 at packet 102.

## Encode comparison

```sh
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -mode encode x-gogeta.wav
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -mode encode -max-nrmse 0.02 x-gogeta.wav
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -mode encode -exact -max-packets 100 x-gogeta.wav
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -mode encode -bitrate 96000 -vbr=false -complexity 5 -max-packets 100 big.wav
```

Inputs must be 48 kHz, mono/stereo, signed 16-bit PCM WAV. Unsupported formats
are rejected, not resampled. Both encoders use the audio application, 20 ms
frames, and identical explicit settings: 64000 bps, VBR enabled, complexity 10
by default. `-bitrate`, `-vbr`, and `-complexity` change both encoders together.
Lookahead must match. Final partial frames are zero-padded and encoder delay is
flushed. `-max-packets N` limits source audio to N frames (N * 20 ms), **plus**
the packets needed to flush delay; 0 processes the full WAV.

The tool compares raw Opus payloads, not Ogg files, so serial numbers, tags,
page layout, and checksums cannot cause spurious differences. No output files
are written. It reports unequal packet counts, unequal length counts, total
payload bytes, and relative total size difference (`abs(Go-C)/C`).

Byte equality is useful but not required by Opus: small floating-point changes
can change encoder decisions and entropy-coded bytes. To measure the resulting
audio difference, both packet streams are decoded by **independent native C
decoders**, isolating encoder differences from Go decoder differences. PCM
statistics exclude lookahead and end padding and include every real input
sample. They include maximum absolute error, RMS error in int16 units, and
NRMSE = RMS(Go-encoded output minus C-encoded output) / RMS(C-encoded output).
For a silent C reference, NRMSE is zero only for an identical output, otherwise
infinity. This is a numerical regression metric, not a perceptual quality test
or a comparison of either lossy output with the original WAV.

Encode PASS requires NRMSE <= `-max-nrmse` (default 0.01 = 1%) and relative
payload size difference <= `-max-size-diff` (default 0.05 = 5%). These are
configurable engineering thresholds, not Opus conformance limits. `-exact`
additionally requires every packet payload to be byte-identical. `-tolerance`
is decode-only. Errors or exceeded thresholds exit with status 1.

Full `x-gogeta.wav` with local libopus 1.6.1 and default settings:

- 8,721 packets; 938 unequal payloads, but all lengths identical.
- Both encoders produced 1,373,589 payload bytes.
- 16,743,696 real PCM samples compared; 1,493,686 differed.
- Maximum PCM error 4,714; RMS error 89.1299; NRMSE 0.0140996 (1.41%).
- Fails the default 1% threshold; would pass an explicitly chosen 2% threshold.

Opt-in native tests cover exact silence encodings, mono/stereo, partial frames,
exact frame boundaries, and limited-input delay flushing. They also compare
converted helpers directly against the local C library: packet headers, entropy
lookups, interpolation (both Go codecs), sorting, bandwidth expansion, biquad
filters, downsampling, limiting, vector renormalization, float-to-PCM conversion,
two-band analysis filtering, sum-of-squares energy, variable low-pass cutoff,
VAD initialization, pitch decoding, Laroia NLSF weights, NLSF vector-quantization
errors, high-quality 2× upsampling (including all six state words), CELT LPC
coefficients, SILK gain dequantization, SILK mid/side-to-left/right conversion,
CELT exponential rotation, and fractional entropy-bit accounting (all normalized
16-bit mantissas at four range scales). Entropy decoder tests also compare interval
updates, probability-coded bits, raw tail bits, and unsigned integers, including
normalization, exhausted packets, overlapping front/tail reads, and invalid-value
clamping. These tests copy context fields explicitly across the C boundary;
`Fbuf` remains a legacy `uintptr`, with its test buffer owner explicitly retained.
SILK decoder comparisons also cover NLSF unpacking/reconstruction/stabilization,
LPC coefficient fitting (including input updates), and shell pulse decoding with
all numeric entropy-state fields checked. Additional decoder tests cover 16-bit
ICDFs, both Laplace variants, and all 5,625 SILK stereo predictor-index combinations
plus mid-only flags. Signed Laplace fixtures avoid zero-probability symbols
(e.g. negative values when `p0=32767`). Inverse prediction gain tests cover stable
and unstable coefficients through order 24; NLSF-to-LPC tests cover both decoder
orders, tightly clustered frequencies, and in-place conversion. LPC analysis
filter comparisons include overflow-heavy inputs and overlapping buffers. Pulse
sign tests cover all signal/offset models, sum masking, padded shell blocks,
skipped pulses, exhausted packets, and every numeric entropy-state field.
Decoder reset/init comparisons verify the nonzero defaults and cleared state,
excluding native CPU dispatch (Go uses scalar arch 0). HQ upsampling wrapper
tests check that only IIR state changes. Full pulse decoding covers the ten-LSB
escape limit and shell/sign reconstruction. PLC energy comparisons include the
actual static helper from `PLC.c`; a `compareopus`-only Go bridge exposes its
internal counterpart. These tests check subframe selection, signed narrowing,
saturation, energies, and shifts. CELT coarse/fine/final energy decoder tests
compare exact float32 outputs and all numeric entropy fields across budget
thresholds, prediction modes, optional previous quantization, and nil final
energy output. Band denormalization is compared bit-for-bit across frame scales,
downsampling factors, silence, exp2 underflow, and capped gains; its band table
is passed as a typed pointer rather than read from the legacy mode field.
Allocation cap tests compare mode tables and channel/frame scales. Hybrid folding
uses a scalar C reference for the static helper in `bands.c`, including bitwise
copies of NaN payloads. Pulse-vector decoding compares native `cwrs.c` vectors,
energies, and entropy state across sparse/dense codebooks. Full PVQ reconstruction
compares libopus output bits, collapse masks, and state across spreading modes,
block counts, gains, and exhausted packets. Its pulse scratch is Go-owned.
Outer per-frame entropy, scalar-output, CTL, and silence scratch objects are
pinned while legacy SILK/CELT uintptr interfaces still use their addresses.
This fixes read-chunk and multistream regressions exposed by stack-layout changes;
it does not establish global pointer safety. Pins can be removed as the complete
call chains become typed.
IIR/FIR interpolation is compared against the actual static libopus helper,
including every Q16 fractional phase, saturated inputs, guard samples, and
input/output overlap. The Go helper returns an output count instead of a
one-past-end pointer. The IIR/FIR driver also compares PCM and complete filter
history across empty, short, exact-batch, multi-batch, and consecutive calls,
including the untouched tail of its FIR union. Its scratch buffer is Go-owned.
Down-FIR interpolation compares all six coefficient sets, 18/24/36-tap orders,
every Q16 phase, int32 pair-sum narrowing, saturation, and output guards against
the actual static C helper. The down-FIR driver additionally checks complete
state and PCM across consecutive calls, partial/multiple batches, and C's
unprocessed one-sample remainder. It accepts a typed coefficient table explicitly
and uses Go-owned scratch, leaving `FCoefs` conversion at the legacy caller.
Pitch cross-correlation is compared bit-for-bit with the scalar implementation
compiled from `pitch.c`, covering four-lag groups, scalar tails, minimal input
extents, and zero-length scalar cases. Stereo-angle inputs are compared exactly
with scalar `vq.c`, including equal/opposite channels, tiny-energy thresholds,
large finite magnitudes, and both stereo and independent-energy modes.
Hadamard interleaving and deinterleaving use typed buffers and Go-owned scratch,
with bitwise comparisons against the actual static `bands.c` helpers for every
supported Hadamard stride and plain transpositions, including NaN payloads,
signed zero, guards, and exact round trips.
Projection matrix initialization uses a typed header/data path and is compared
against libopus for metadata, aligned coefficient offsets, and matrix sizes up
to the channel/count limits. Pointer tests also preserve forward-copy aliasing.
Projection float output is compared bit-for-bit across matrix columns, input and
output strides, preloaded accumulators, empty frames, and aliased input/output.
Projection int16 output additionally covers ties-to-even input conversion,
NaN/infinity clamping, Q15 product rounding, and wrapping output accumulation.
Projection int24 output checks finite inputs within C's int32 conversion domain,
including values beyond normalized unity, ties-to-even conversion, 64-bit
products, asymmetric Q15 half rounding, and int32 accumulation narrowing.
Float-to-PCM conversion, VAD initialization,
Laroia weights, sum-of-squares, bandwidth expansion (16/32-bit), 2:1 downsampling,
analysis filter bank, high-quality 2× upsampling, mono/stereo biquads, low-pass
cutoff control, and pitch decoding tests cover both `opuscc` and `opusccenc`.
The encoder float-to-PCM test also checks C's NaN-to-−32768 behavior.
The cutoff test compares PCM and state at every transition position in both
directions; its static tap helper also has exhaustive Q16 interpolation tests
in `opuscc`.

Integer helper comparisons are exact. Renormalization must exactly match a C
implementation of the scalar formula from `vq.c`/`pitch.h`. The linked native
build presumes SSE even with `arch=0`, so its different accumulation order is
checked separately with a relative bound of eight float32 machine epsilons
(about 9.54e-7). The initial maximum observed relative difference was 4.56e-7.
Run that test with `-v` to see the measured difference:

```sh
go test -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus
go test -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -run TestRenormaliseAgainstC -v
```
