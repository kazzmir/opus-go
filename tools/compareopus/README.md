# Native C / Go decoder comparison

Run from the repository root (requires cgo and a C compiler):

```sh
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus test.opus
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -max-packets 100 test.opus test2.opus test3.opus
go run -tags compareopus ./tools/compareopus -tolerance 1 -max-packets 100 big.opus
```

With no file arguments, it tries every `*.opus` in the current directory.
The `compareopus` build tag excludes this program from normal `go test ./...`.

The cgo directives in `main.go` use headers from `../opus/include` and statically
link `../opus/.libs/libopus.a`, relative to the repository root. This is the
native checkout found next to this repository; `../opus-go` is the Go checkout
itself. Build the native library first if necessary. Edit the two `#cgo`
directives if your native checkout is elsewhere. The program prints the linked
libopus version.

Each file gets independent, fresh C and Go decoders. The same Ogg audio packets
are decoded through each library's int16 API at 48 kHz, without FEC. Family 0
uses the ordinary decoder; families 1, 2, and 255 use multistream decoding with
the header's mapping. Other families are rejected.

This compares **raw decoder PCM**, including pre-skip and end padding. Neither
side applies OpusHead gain, pre-skip, or granule trimming: container playback
processing cannot mask decoder differences. Sample counts include all channels;
reported packet numbers are one-based, frame/channel indices are zero-based.

By default every sample must match exactly. The report includes the first sample
outside tolerance, total differing samples, samples outside tolerance, maximum
absolute difference, and RMS difference in int16 units. `-tolerance` optionally
allows small differences; exact mismatch counts remain visible. Native build
options, SIMD, and floating-point evaluation can affect bit-exactness; a
mismatch is evidence to investigate, not automatically proof of a Go bug.

Exit status is 0 only when all requested comparisons succeed, 1 for mismatches
or file/decode errors, and 2 for invalid options or no inputs. Empty audio
packets are rejected rather than silently treated as packet-loss concealment.
A read/decode error aborts that file, but subsequent files are still tried.
`-max-packets N` intentionally compares only a prefix; 0 (default) reads to EOF.

Initial checks against the local libopus 1.6.1:

- First 100 packets of `test.opus`, `test2.opus`, and `test3.opus`: exact matches.
- First 100 packets of `big.opus`: 26 differing samples, maximum difference 1.
- Full reads of the three test files encounter empty audio packets (packet 5648
  for `test.opus`/`test2.opus`, packet 103 for `test3.opus`), reported as errors.
  `test.opus` and `test2.opus` also first differ by 1 at packet 102.
